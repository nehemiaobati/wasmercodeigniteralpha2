Simple \"Hello, World!\" Script\n\nThis is the most basic example, which simply prints a string of text to the browser.\n\n```php\n<?php\n    echo \"Hello, World!\";\n?>\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n*   `<?php` and `?>` mark the beginning and end of the PHP code block.\n*   `echo` is a language construct used to output one or more strings.\n*   The statement ends with a semicolon (`;`).\n\n### 2. Using Variables and Concatenation\n\nThis example demonstrates how to declare a variable and combine it with a string (concatenation).\n\n```php\n<?php\n    \/\/ Variables in PHP start with a dollar sign ($)\n    $name = \"Alice\";\n    $age = 30;\n\n    \/\/ The dot (.) is the concatenation operator in PHP\n    echo \"My name is \" . $name . \" and I am \" . $age . \" years old.\";\n?>\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\nMy name is Alice and I am 30 years old.\n```\n\n### 3. Mixing PHP with HTML\n\nPHP is often embedded directly within an HTML file to generate dynamic content.\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>PHP Test<\/title>\n<\/head>\n<body>\n    <h1>\n        <?php\n            \/\/ This PHP code will output text inside the HTML H1 tag\n            echo \"Welcome to my dynamic page!\";\n        ?>\n    <\/h1>\n    <p>The time is currently: \n        <?php\n            \/\/ Using a built-in function to display the current date and time\n            echo date('h:i:s a');\n        ?>\n    <\/p>\n<\/body>\n<\/html>\n```\n**Explanation:**\n*   You can jump in and out of PHP mode (with `<?php` and `?>`) anywhere in your HTML document.\n*   The `date()` function is a built-in PHP function used here to format and output the current server time.",

If it's a direct navigation (GET request), the validation code is skipped, and the blank form is displayed.\n\n3.  **Input Sanitization and Security:**\n    *   The `test_input()` function is used on all incoming POST data. It:\n        *   `trim()`: Removes excess whitespace from the beginning and end of the string.\n        *   `stripslashes()`: Removes backslashes added by some server configurations.\n        *   `htmlspecialchars()`: Converts special HTML characters (like `<` and `>`) into their HTML entities. This prevents any malicious scripts a user might enter from being executed when the data is echoed back to the page or saved. **This is a fundamental security practice.**\n\n4.  **Displaying Previous Data:**\n    *   The `value` attribute of the input fields uses `value=\"<?php echo htmlspecialchars($name); ?>\"` to display the data the user entered if the validation fails. This prevents the user from having to re-type all their information. Notice the use of `htmlspecialchars()` again to safely output the user's data.\n\n5.  **Displaying Errors:**\n    *   If a field fails validation (e.g., an empty required field), the corresponding error message variable (e.g., `$nameErr`) is set.\n    *   The PHP code `<?php echo $nameErr; ?>` displays the error message right below the field.\n\n6.  **Success State:**\n    *   The main PHP block sets `$submission_success = true` only if all validation passes.\n    *   The HTML uses `<?php if ($submission_success): ?>` to conditionally display the **Thank You** message instead of the form.",

(This file will store the submitted emails).\n3.  **Use a Web Server:** You need a PHP-enabled web server (like **XAMPP**, **WAMP**, or **MAMP** for local development) to execute the PHP code.\n4.  **Access:** Place the `index.php` and `subscribers.txt` files in your web server's document root (e.g., `htdocs` in XAMPP) and access it via your browser (e.g., `http:\/\/localhost\/index.php`).\n\n### Key PHP Concepts in the Sample\n\n*   **`<?php ... ?>`:** The tags that enclose PHP code.\n*   **`$_SERVER[\"REQUEST_METHOD\"]`:** A superglobal variable used to check which method was used to access the page (in this case, checking for `POST` to confirm a form submission).\n*   **`$_POST[\"email\"]`:** A superglobal array used to collect values in the form data sent with the `POST` method. The key (`\"email\"`) matches the `name` attribute of the form input.\n*   **`htmlspecialchars()` and `stripslashes()`:** Essential functions used to sanitize user input to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, which is a crucial security practice.\n*   **`filter_var($email, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)`:** A built-in PHP function for checking if a string is a valid email address format.\n*   **`file_put_contents()`:** A simple function used here to write the collected email to the `subscribers.txt` file, demonstrating basic data storage.",

It ensures the PHP code inside the block only executes when the form is submitted (i.e., when data is sent via the `POST` method), not when the page is first loaded. |\n| **Line 11-12** | `$_POST['name'];` | **Input Retrieval:** The `$_POST` superglobal array is used to access the data sent from the HTML form. The keys (`'name'`, `'email'`) match the `name` attributes of the form's input fields. The `trim()` function removes any extra whitespace. |\n| **Line 16-20** | `if (empty($name) ... elseif (!filter_var...` | **Validation:** Checks if the required fields are empty and uses the built-in `filter_var()` function with `FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL` for basic email format validation. If validation fails, it sets an `$message`. |\n| **Line 24-27** | `\/\/ Processing the data` | **The Core Action:** This is where you would execute the main landing page goal, such as sending an email to a recipient or saving the captured lead to a database. |\n| **Line 47-51** | `if (!empty($message)) { ... echo \"<div class='message $class'>$message<\/div>\"; }` | **Output Display:** Checks if there is a status message to display (either success or error). If so, it dynamically prints an HTML `div` with the appropriate CSS class (`success` or `error`) based on the `$success` variable. |\n| **Line 60, 65** | `value=\"<?php echo htmlspecialchars($name); ?>\"` | **Sticky Form Fields:** This uses the stored `$name` (or `$email`) to pre-fill the form fields. This is a good user experience practice, especially if validation fails, as the user doesn't have to re-type their information. `htmlspecialchars()` is used to prevent **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)** attacks by ensuring any special characters in the user's input are treated as data, not as executable HTML. |\n| **Line 57** | `action=\"<?php echo htmlspecialchars($_SERVER[\"PHP_SELF\"]); ?>\"` | **Form Target:** This tells the form to submit the data back to the same script (`index.php`), which is known as a \"self-submitting form.\" `htmlspecialchars()` is used here for security as well. |",

    "result": "A sample PHP landing page usually involves two main components: the front-end design (HTML\/CSS) and the back-end logic (PHP) for handling form submissions, which is a key element of any landing page.\n\nHere is a conceptual, simple example structured into two files:\n\n1.  **`index.php`**: The main page containing the HTML form and display logic.\n2.  **`process_form.php`**: The script that handles the data submitted from the form.\n\n---\n\n### 1. The Landing Page File (`index.php`)\n\nThis file contains the HTML structure and a basic lead-capture form. It uses PHP to check for a success or error message after a submission and display it to the user.\n\n```php\n<?php\n\/\/ PHP logic to check for messages after a form submission.\n\/\/ These messages would typically be set in 'process_form.php' and passed\n\/\/ back via a URL parameter (like index.php?status=success) or a session variable.\n\n$message = '';\n$message_class = '';\n\nif (isset($_GET['status'])) {\n    if ($_GET['status'] === 'success') {\n        $message = \"Thank you!

The Form Processing File (`process_form.php`)\n\nThis file contains the core PHP logic to validate the data, handle it (e.g., save to a database or send an email), and redirect the user back to the landing page with a status message.\n\n```php\n<?php\n\n\/\/ Check if the form was submitted using the POST method\nif ($_SERVER[\"REQUEST_METHOD\"] == \"POST\") {\n\n    \/\/ 1.

Handle the Data (This is where your core logic goes)\n    \/\/ ---\n    \/\/ Example: Save to a simple text file\n    $data = \"Name: $name, Email: $email\\n\";\n    $file = 'leads.txt';\n\n    if (file_put_contents($file, $data, FILE_APPEND | LOCK_EX) !== false) {\n        \/\/ Success: Redirect back to the landing page with a success status\n        header(\"Location: index.php?status=success\");\n        exit;\n    } else {\n        \/\/ Error handling for file write failure (or database connection\/query failure)\n        header(\"Location: index.php?status=error\");\n        exit;\n    }\n\n    \/\/ ---\n    \/\/ In a real application, this is where you would:\n    \/\/ a) Connect to a database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) and save the lead.\n    \/\/ b) Send the lead data to a CRM or email marketing service (via an API call).\n    \/\/ c) Send a confirmation email to the user.\n} else {\n    \/\/ If someone tries to access this page directly, redirect them to the home page\n    header(\"Location: index.php\");\n    exit;\n}\n\n?>\n```\n\n### Key Takeaways for PHP Landing Pages\n\n*   **HTML & PHP Integration:** PHP code is embedded directly within HTML (`index.php`) to conditionally display content (like the success message).\n*   **Form Processing Separation:** It's best practice to separate the form *display* (`index.php`) from the form *handling logic* (`process_form.php`).\n*   **Redirection:** After processing data, the script redirects the user (`header(\"Location: ...\")`) instead of just displaying a blank screen, which provides a much better user experience.\n*   **Validation:** Always validate and sanitize user input (`filter_input`) to prevent security issues and ensure data quality.\n\nFor a full, modern, and visually appealing template, you can find various free and paid HTML\/PHP templates on resources like PHPJabbers or Envato.

The `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` variable is a superglobal that points to the current script (`index.php`), which means the form data is submitted back to itself. This is a secure and convenient way to handle form processing and validation on one page.\n    *   The `htmlspecialchars()` function is used for security to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks by converting special characters into HTML entities.\n\n2.  **Form Data Retrieval:**\n    *   The script uses `if ($_SERVER[\"REQUEST_METHOD\"] == \"POST\")` to ensure the processing logic only runs after the form has been submitted using the `POST` method.\n    *   User input is accessed using the `$_POST` superglobal array, for example, `$_POST[\"name\"]`.\n\n3.  **Sanitization and Validation:**\n    *   **`trim()`**: Removes unnecessary characters (extra spaces, tabs, newlines) from the user input.\n    *   **`filter_var()` and `FILTER_SANITIZE_...`**: These functions clean up the input, like removing illegal characters from an email address (Sanitization).\n    *   **`filter_var()` and `FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL`**: Checks if the email input is a valid email format (Validation).\n    *   **Error Handling**: If an error is found (e.g., the name field is empty), an error message is stored in a variable (`$name_error`), which is then displayed next to the relevant form field.\n\n4.  **Value Persistence:**\n    *   Notice the `value` attribute on the input fields: `value=\"<?php echo $success ? '' : htmlspecialchars($name); ?>\"`. This crucial part of the user experience uses PHP to re-insert the user's previously entered data (stored in the `$name` variable) if the form submission failed. This prevents the user from having to re-type everything after an error. The ternary operator (`$success ? '' : ...`) is used to clear the form only upon a successful submission.",

It ensures the code inside the block only runs when the page has been loaded as a result of the form being submitted (via the `POST` method).\n\n2.  **Accessing Form Data:**\n    ```php\n    $name = trim($_POST['name'] ?? '');\n    ```\n    The `$_POST` superglobal array is how PHP receives data sent from an HTML form. The `name` attribute of the HTML input (`<input name=\"name\">`) becomes the key in the `$_POST` array.\n\n3.  **Security and Validation:**\n    *   `trim()` removes unnecessary whitespace.\n    *   `filter_var($email, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)` is a simple, effective way to check if an email is correctly formatted.\n    *   `htmlspecialchars()` is used when displaying the user's previously entered data (`value=\"<?php echo $form_data['name']; ?>\"`) to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.\n\n4.  **Displaying Dynamic Content:**\n    ```php\n    <?php echo $success_message; ?>\n    ```\n    PHP variables are used to store messages and form field values. This allows the landing page to provide immediate feedback to the user on the same page after submission, which is a key component of a good landing page experience.",

    "result": "PHP is a server-side scripting language primarily used for web development. All PHP code must be enclosed in the special PHP tags `<?php` and `?>`.\n\nHere are four sample codes covering fundamental concepts.\n\n***\n\n### 1. Basic Output (Hello World)\n\nThis is the simplest PHP program, which uses the `echo` statement to output text to the browser.\n\n| Code | Description |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **`hello.php`** | |\n| ```php |\n| <?php | The opening PHP tag. |\n| echo \"Hello, World!\"; | The `echo` statement is used to display output. |\n| ?> | The closing PHP tag. |\n| ``` | |\n| **Output:** | |\n| `Hello, World!` | |\n\n***\n\n### 2. Variables and Simple Arithmetic\n\nPHP variables start with a dollar sign (`$`). You don't need to declare their type.\n\n| Code | Description |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **`variables.php`** | |\n| ```php |\n| <?php |\n| $num1 = 15; | Assigns the integer 15 to the variable `$num1`. |\n| $num2 = 7; | Assigns the integer 7 to the variable `$num2`. |\n| $sum = $num1 + $num2; | Performs an addition. |\n| | |\n| echo \"The first number is: \" . $num1 . \"<br>\"; | Displays the value of `$num1` (The `.` is the **concatenation** operator). |\n| echo \"The sum is: \" . $sum; | Displays the calculated sum. (`<br>` is an HTML line break). |\n| ?> |\n| ``` | |\n| **Output:** | |\n| The first number is: 15 | |\n| The sum is: 22 | |\n\n***\n\n### 3. Conditional Logic (If\/Else Statement)\n\nThis code demonstrates how to execute different blocks of code based on a condition using `if` and `else`.\n\n| Code | Description |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **`conditional.php`** | |\n| ```php |\n| <?php |\n| $temperature = 35; | Sets the initial temperature. |\n| | |\n| if ($temperature > 30) { | Checks if the temperature is greater than 30. |\n|     echo \"It's a hot day!\"; | Executes if the condition is TRUE. |\n| } else { | If the condition is FALSE, execute the `else` block. |\n|     echo \"The weather is moderate.\"; | Executes if the condition is FALSE (i.e., $temperature is 30 or less). |\n| } |\n| ?> |\n| ``` | |\n| **Output:** | |\n| `It's a hot day!` | |\n\n***\n\n### 4. Arrays and Looping (Foreach)\n\nArrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable. The `foreach` loop is the most common way to iterate (loop) over an array.\n\n| Code | Description |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **`array_loop.php`** | |\n| ```php |\n| <?php |\n| \/\/ An array of fruits |\n| $fruits = [\"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"Cherry\", \"Date\"]; |\n| | |\n| echo \"My Favorite Fruits: <br>\"; |\n| | |\n| foreach ($fruits as $fruit) { | Loops through each element in the `$fruits` array. |\n|     echo \"- \" . $fruit . \"<br>\"; | In each loop, `$fruit` holds the current value. |\n| } |\n| ?> |\n| ``` | |\n| **Output:** | |\n| My Favorite Fruits: | |\n| - Apple | |\n| - Banana | |\n| - Cherry | |\n| - Date | |",

A Two-Part Story\nYou requested a story, and I wrote a short narrative in two parts about a librarian named Elara:\n\n*   **Part 1:** Elara discovers an embedded piece of obsidian in a book, the *Compendium of Lost Cartography*, on **Friday, October 18th, 2025**. The obsidian acts as a key, revealing a cryptic message on a map of the Whispering Marshes: \"**The wound heals at midnight**,\" referencing a one-hundred-year-old disappearance.\n*   **Part 2:** Elara continues her investigation and finds a record of a mysterious land purchase for a site called \"**The Silent Circle**,\" which was sealed exactly a century ago (October 18th, 1925) and is set to be **unsealed at midnight on October 18th, 2025**. She realizes she is being hunted by someone else in the library as she races to reach the location before the deadline.\n\n***\n\nWe also had a brief exchange when you sent a \"hello\" later that Friday evening.",

Core Purpose & Scope (Part I)**\n\n*   **Purpose:** The Act provides for the compensation of employees for **work-related injuries and diseases contracted in the course of their employment** (Page 4).\n*   **Application:** It applies to **all employees**, including those employed by the Government, but specifically excludes members of the Armed Forces (Section 3 & 7(d) on Page 7).\n*   **Key Definitions:** Defines core terms like:\n    *   **\"Accident\":** An accident arising out of and in the course and scope of an employee's employment resulting in personal injury (Page 4).\n    *   **\"Employee\":** A person employed for wages or a salary under a contract of service, including an apprentice or indentured learner (Page 6).\n    *   **\"Employer\":** Any person who employs an employee, including the Government (Page 6).\n    *   **\"Dependant\":** Includes a widow\/widower and children under the age of eighteen, as defined in Section 6 (Page 7).\n\n#### **II. Obligations of Employers (Part II)**\n\nThe Act places mandatory duties on employers to ensure employee protection:\n\n*   **Insurance (Section 7):** Every employer must obtain and maintain an **insurance policy** with an approved insurer to cover their liabilities under the Act.\n*   **Registration (Section 8):** Employers carrying on business in Kenya must **register** with the Director of Work Injury Benefits and furnish particulars of their business.\n*   **Record Keeping (Section 9):** Employers must **keep records** of earnings and other particulars of all employees for at least six years.\n\n#### **III.

    "result": "The chill of the night air on **Friday, October 18th, 2025,** hit Elara with the suddenness of a shockwave. She ran until the paved streets of Oakhaven dissolved into packed dirt roads, and the friendly, flickering porch lights gave way to the absolute, looming darkness of the wilderness.\n\nHer lungs burned, but the adrenaline\u2014fueled by the thought of the man pursuing her and the obsidian burning against her hip\u2014kept her moving. She checked her watch in the faint light cast by the crescent moon: **9:28 PM.**\n\nShe stopped at the precipice of the Whispering Marshes. The name wasn't folklore; it was a promise. The air here was heavy, scented with stagnant water and decaying leaves, and the only sound was a faint, susurrus rustling\u2014the sound of the wind moving across hundreds of acres of tall, reeds and cattails. This was where roads ended and history truly began.\n\nThe map\u2014the mental imprint of the one she\u2019d seen in the *Compendium*\u2014was useless here. The marshes shifted and swallowed landmarks yearly. But the obsidian was her compass.\n\nShe pulled the stone from her pocket. It was no longer merely warm; it pulsed with a low, rhythmic heat, and as she held it aloft, the etched crescent moon and eye symbol began to emit a pale, inner blue light, faint as a dying star.\n\nShe followed the blue light, forcing herself into the marsh. The ground immediately turned spongy, pulling at her boots. Within fifty yards, she was ankle-deep in cold, black water. The reeds towered over her, forming a natural, twisting labyrinth that defied direction.\n\n*\u201cThe true map is not of land, but of memory.\u201d*\n\nShe realized the obsidian wasn't showing her the way *to* a location, but the path *taken* a century ago. She had to walk Thorne\u2019s memory.\n\nShe pressed forward, trusting the stone. Minutes later, she heard it\u2014not the whispering of the reeds, but a sound from behind.\n\nA powerful, focused beam of white LED light sliced through the distant marsh growth, sweeping violently from side to side. The man from the library was here, and he wasn't navigating; he was cutting a straight path.\n\nElara ducked behind a clump of heavy reeds, plunging her feet deeper into the muck. The man was moving too quickly, too efficiently for someone unfamiliar with the Marsh. He must have known the terrain, or perhaps, like her, he was following a hidden path\u2014or a hidden signal.\n\nThe light beam stopped its sweep, fixed directly on the spot where she had been running moments before.\n\n\"The Silent Circle requires absolute silence, Librarian,\" the man's voice echoed, muffled but carrying across the damp air. \"The Trust guards the *absence* of history, not its resurrection. Turn back before you drown in the past.\"\n\nHis words weren't a threat; they were a statement of philosophy, delivered with chilling certainty.\n\nElara pushed deeper, the blue light of the obsidian intensifying slightly as she rounded a corner of densely packed marsh grass.\n\nShe gasped.\n\nIn front of her, the reeds parted to reveal an area of remarkably firm, dry ground. It was a circular, unnatural clearing of black, cracked earth, utterly devoid of plant life. In the very center stood a structure.\n\nIt wasn't a building, or a ruin, but a pedestal carved from grey, featureless stone. It was exactly where the old map had marked **\"The Silent Circle.\"**\n\nAs she stepped onto the dry ground, the surrounding marsh seemed to hold its breath. The whispering stopped.\n\nShe looked at her watch: **9:45 PM.** She had two hours and fifteen minutes before midnight.\n\nShe hurried toward the pedestal. It was waist-high and covered in a thick layer of dried mud and century-old dust. She brushed it away, revealing strange, geometric etchings around its base.\n\nIn the center of the pedestal was a deep, square-shaped depression, clearly designed to hold something. And beneath the depression, inscribed in elegant script, was a single, chilling instruction:\n\n***HERE LIES THE WOUND.***\n\n***SEAL IT WITH SILENCE, AND ONLY THE ECHO REMAINS.***\n\nElara looked from the square depression to the obsidian in her hand. The stone was smooth, but it was not square. It was trapezoidal.\n\nShe hesitated, then realized the truth: the key she held was not meant to *open* the site, but to *complete* the seal. The obsidian was only one piece. The true mechanism was still missing.\n\nA splash sounded nearby, followed by the heavy, measured crunch of boots on the firm, dry earth of the Circle.\n\nElara spun around. The man, tall and dressed in dark, functional clothing, stood just ten feet away, holding the powerful LED flashlight steady.\n\nIn his other hand, he held a small, dark, polished box made of ironwood. He looked at the pedestal, then at Elara.\n\n\"You have the memory, Elara. I have the silence,\" he said, his voice flat. He stepped closer to the pedestal, reaching into the box.\n\n\"The key Thorne left was only a warning. The Trust ensured that the *final* piece\u2014the Seal of Absolution\u2014was kept safe until midnight, when the Circle would officially be reclaimed by nature, its contents lost forever.\"\n\nHe pulled a second piece of obsidian from the box. It was a perfect, square counterpart to Elara's own stone.\n\n\"You may have delayed the sealing, Librarian,\" he concluded, stepping toward the square depression. \"But you cannot prevent it.\"",

    "result": "The man\u2014the guardian of silence\u2014moved with deliberate, terrifying calm. He didn't rush, because he didn't need to. He knew the clock was his ally, ticking down toward the absolute finality of midnight.\n\nHe lifted the square piece of obsidian, the **Seal of Absolution**, and lowered it into the waiting depression on the pedestal. It settled with a faint, chilling *click*.\n\nThe moment it locked into place, the geometric etchings around the pedestal\u2019s base began to pulse with a sickly, forest-green light. The light didn't illuminate; it seemed to *absorb* the surrounding moonlight.\n\nThe space remaining in the depression was perfectly trapezoidal\u2014the exact shape of Elara\u2019s stone.\n\n\u201cIt holds the absence of Silas Thorne,\u201d the man explained, taking a step back, his eyes fixed on Elara, ignoring the pulsating green light. \u201cThorne did not map land; he mapped *moments*. He discovered a way to excise a piece of history\u2014a wound in the timeline\u2014and hold it here, in stasis, for a century.\u201d\n\nElara tightened her grip on the trapezoidal obsidian, feeling the heat of the stone fighting the cold certainty of the man\u2019s presence. \"Why? What did he excise?\"\n\n\"A truth the world was not ready for, or perhaps, a lie too dangerous to be remembered,\" the guardian whispered. \"The Trust was established to ensure that when the hundred years elapsed, the seal would be made permanent. By placing both pieces, the pedestal activates, not to open, but to compress the wound entirely. It turns the memory\u2014your stone\u2014into permanent silence, my stone. By midnight, there will be no evidence Thorne ever existed.\"\n\nHe held out his hand. \"Give it to me, Librarian. Finish the task. History is safer when it remains predictable.\"\n\nElara looked down at the pedestal. The green light intensified, and a faint, high-pitched *whine* began to emanate from the stone. The clock on her wrist read **9:48 PM**.\n\nShe realized the trap. If she placed her stone, she would erase Thorne\u2019s legacy. But if she *didn't* place it, the guardian would simply overpower her and do it himself.\n\n\"You call it silence,\" Elara challenged, her voice trembling but steady. \"I call it erasure. Thorne wanted it found.\"\n\n\"He was an idealist,\" the man scoffed.\n\nElara took a step forward, raising her obsidian. The blue light of the 'Memory Stone' fought against the green field emanating from the pedestal. The stones seemed magnetically opposed, yet destined to complete the circuit.\n\n\"The map said, 'The wound heals at midnight',\" Elara murmured, remembering the cryptic phrase. \"Wounds don't heal by being sealed; they heal by being exposed.\"\n\nShe didn't place the stone in the empty socket. Instead, with a sudden surge of adrenaline, she lunged sideways, spinning the obsidian around her head and bringing its sharp, curved edge down onto the surface of the green-pulsing square stone already set in the pedestal.\n\nA deafening **KRAAAACCKK!** ripped through the air.\n\nThe high-pitched whine immediately changed pitch, dropping into a deep, guttural vibration that shook the dry earth of the Silent Circle. The green light didn't vanish; it exploded into a blinding white flash.\n\nThe man cried out, stumbling back, clutching his eyes.\n\nElara shielded her own face, the trapezoidal obsidian hot and vibrating fiercely in her hand. The pedestal, instead of being destroyed, had been *activated*.\n\nWhen the flash subsided, the Silence Guardian was gone, vanished into the sudden, swirling fog that had instantly materialized across the Circle.\n\nElara stared at the pedestal. Her stone was still whole, but the guardian\u2019s square seal was fractured, lines of glowing blue electricity spiderwebbing across its surface.\n\nThe central square depression\u2014the wound\u2014was no longer empty. It shimmered with an unbearable distortion, like looking at hot air over asphalt, except the distortion was focused and deep, pooling in the center of the pedestal.\n\nA sound started\u2014not a whisper, not a chime, but the distinct, echoing *clang* of an old, heavy printing press running at impossible speed.\n\nFrom the pool of distortion, a sheet of ancient, brittle paper materialized, hovering above the pedestal. It was a new map, covered in ink that was somehow still wet.\n\nElara cautiously reached out and grasped the edge of the paper. It was a single-page addendum to the *Compendium of Lost Cartography*.\n\nThe ink burned her fingertips, and she looked down at the contents, ignoring the frantic pounding of her heart. It wasn't a map of Oakhaven. It was a map of the entire eastern seaboard, overlaid with intricate, glowing temporal vectors.\n\nAnd scrawled across the center, the new ink read:\n\n***THE WOUND IS OPEN. THE ECHO RISES.***\n\n***MIDNIGHT IS NOT THE SEALING. MIDNIGHT IS THE RELEASE.***\n\nElara looked up. The silent, swirling mist was gone. She was alone again, but the marsh was quiet, attentive. Her watch read **9:55 PM**.\n\nShe was no longer racing to prevent a seal. She was racing to understand a release, an event a century in the making that would happen in just over two hours, and the map in her hand was the only guide to whatever Silas Thorne had hidden. She turned and ran, the temporal map clutched in her hand, toward the only sign of civilization visible in the distance: the faint, ominous glow of Oakhaven's oldest clock tower.",

    "result": "This Policy Guideline outlines the framework for allowing government employers to self-insure against liabilities arising under the Work Injury Benefits Act (WIBA), 2007, shifting away from reliance on commercial insurance providers.\n\nHere is a summary of the key components of the guideline:\n\n---\n\n## Summary of the Policy Guideline on Self-Insurance\n\n### 1. Rationale and Legal Basis\n\n*   **Background:** The WIBA, 2007 mandates employers to insure against work-related injury liabilities. Commercial insurance has proven costly, inflexible, and leads to the diversion of public resources. Self-insurance is proposed as a sustainable alternative offering cost savings and greater control.\n*   **Legal Foundation:** Section 7 of the WIBA, 2007 empowers the Minister to exempt employers from compulsory insurance if they provide and maintain adequate security as prescribed. This framework is also supported by the Public Finance Management Act, 2012.\n*   **Scope:** The self-insurance framework applies to **all government ministries, departments, agencies, and state corporations.**\n\n### 2. Objectives\n\nThe primary goals of establishing the self-insurance framework are to:\n\n1.  Reduce expenditure on expensive commercial insurance premiums.\n2.  Retain and reinvest funds within the government financial system.\n3.  Enhance transparency and accountability in compensation processes.\n4.  Ensure predictable and adequate resources for employee claims.\n\n### 3. Operational Model and Finance\n\n*   **Self-Insurance Fund:** A dedicated fund will be established to pool resources from across government entities.\n*   **Funding Sources:** Resources will come from annual budgetary allocations, employer contributions, and income generated from the investment of reserves.\n*   **Security Requirements:** To obtain an exemption, government entities must demonstrate financial capacity and comply with WIBA security requirements, which include maintaining reserve funds, government guarantees, or approved financial instruments.\n*   **Sustainability:** Financial sustainability will be guaranteed through **annual actuarial valuations** to assess reserve adequacy, clear investment guidelines, and mechanisms for timely replenishment and top-up of reserves. Pooling risks across multiple agencies enhances predictability.\n\n### 4. Governance and Institutional Arrangements\n\n*   **The Self-Insurance Secretariat:** Established within the responsible ministry, this body will manage the day-to-day operations, including claims administration, financial management, actuarial reviews, and reporting.\n*   **Oversight Committee:** This committee, comprising representatives from Treasury, the Ministry of Public Service, and independent experts, will provide governance and accountability.\n*   **Reporting:** The Secretariat will submit periodic reports to the Minister and the Auditor-General. Annual audits will be conducted by the Auditor-General or an independent auditor.\n\n### 5. Risk Management\n\nKey risks identified include insufficient reserves, delayed claims settlement, and governance failures. Mitigation strategies include:\n\n*   Mandatory annual actuarial reviews.\n*   Adherence to statutory claims settlement timelines.\n*   Strong oversight mechanisms and independent audits.\n\n### 6. Implementation (Transition Plan)\n\nThe rollout of the self-insurance model is structured into four phases over 12 months (Annex 2):\n\n| Phase | Activity | Timeline |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Phase 1: Situational Analysis** | Conduct actuarial study and map baseline liabilities. | Months 1\u20132 |\n| **Phase 2: Institutional Setup** | Establish the Self-Insurance Fund and Secretariat; develop policies. | Months 3\u20134 |\n| **Phase 3: Pilot Implementation** | Implement the scheme in selected ministries\/agencies. | Months 5\u20136 |\n| **Phase 4: Full Roll-Out** | Extend coverage across all government entities and refine the framework. | Months 7\u201312 |\n\n### 7. Advantages of Self-Insurance\n\nThe framework provides significant benefits compared to commercial insurance (Annex 1):\n\n| Criteria | Self-Insurance (Government) | Commercial Insurance |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Cost** | Lower overall cost; avoids insurer profit margins and commissions. | High premiums; includes insurer profits. |\n| **Control** | Full control over policy design, coverage, and claims handling. | Limited control; insurer dictates terms. |\n| **Fund Retention**| Funds are retained within and reinvested by the government. | Funds flow to private insurers. |\n| **Transparency** | Subject to public audit and reporting standards. | Dependent on limited insurer disclosures. |\n| **Flexibility** | Policy can be adapted to evolve employee welfare needs and align with government social protection policies. | Rigid policy terms not tailored to government objectives. |",

The Public Finance Management Act, 2012, also supports the framework.\n\nThe self-insurance model applies to **all government ministries, departments, agencies, and state corporations**, provided they demonstrate the necessary financial capacity and comply with security requirements to receive Ministerial exemption.\n\n### 3. Operational Model and Funding\n\nA centralized system will be established based on resource pooling:\n\n*   **Self-Insurance Fund:** A dedicated fund will be established to pool financial resources across all participating government entities.\n*   **Funding Sources:** Resources will come from annual budgetary allocations, employer contributions, and income generated from the investment of reserves.\n*   **Security:** Acceptable forms of security to guarantee claim payouts include reserve funds, government guarantees, or approved financial instruments.\n*   **Claims Management:** Processes will be established for timely notification, assessment, and settlement of claims in line with statutory timelines.\n\n### 4. Governance and Institutional Arrangements\n\nTo ensure accountability and efficient management, two main bodies will be created:\n\n1.  **Self-Insurance Secretariat:** Established within the responsible ministry, this body will manage the day-to-day operations, including claims administration, financial management, actuarial reviews, and reporting.\n2.  **Oversight Committee:** This committee, comprising representatives from Treasury, the Ministry of Public Service, and independent experts, will provide governance, strategic direction, and accountability.\n\n### 5. Financial Management and Sustainability\n\nSustainability hinges on rigorous financial discipline and risk pooling:\n\n*   **Actuarial Valuations:** Must be conducted annually to determine the adequacy of reserves and liabilities.\n*   **Risk Pooling:** Pooling risks across multiple government agencies is intended to enhance financial sustainability and predictability.\n*   **Solvency Guarantee:** Clear investment guidelines and mechanisms for the replenishment and top-up of reserves will be put in place to guarantee the scheme\u2019s solvency.\n\n### 6. Monitoring, Reporting, and Risk Management\n\nRobust oversight mechanisms are mandated to mitigate risks like insufficient reserves or delayed settlements:\n\n*   **Reporting:** The Secretariat must submit quarterly financial and claims reports to oversight authorities.\n*   **Audits:** Annual audits will be conducted by the Auditor-General or an independent auditor.\n*   **Risk Mitigation:** Key mitigation measures include mandatory actuarial reviews, adherence to statutory claims settlement timelines, and strong independent oversight.\n\n### 7. Transition Plan (Roadmap)\n\nThe implementation will occur in four sequential phases over a planned timeline of 7 to 12 months:\n\n| Phase | Activity | Timeline |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Phase 1: Situational Analysis** | Conduct actuarial study and map liabilities. | Months 1\u20132 |\n| **Phase 2: Institutional Setup** | Establish the Self-Insurance Fund, create the Secretariat, and develop policies\/systems. | Months 3\u20134 |\n| **Phase 3: Pilot Implementation** | Implement the scheme in selected ministries\/agencies and monitor outcomes. | Months 5\u20136 |\n| **Phase 4: Full Roll-Out** | Extend coverage across all government entities and refine the framework based on pilot lessons. | Months 7\u201312 |",

Handling HTML Form Submissions\n\nThis example shows how PHP handles data sent from an HTML form using the `POST` method.\n\n**File:** `form.php` (Contains both the form and the processing logic)\n\n```php\n<?php\n\/\/ Initialize variables for feedback\n$message = \"\";\n\n\/\/ Check if the form was submitted\nif ($_SERVER[\"REQUEST_METHOD\"] == \"POST\") {\n    \n    \/\/ Use the filter_input function for secure retrieval of POST data\n    $username = filter_input(INPUT_POST, 'username', FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING);\n    $email = filter_input(INPUT_POST, 'email', FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL);\n\n    if (empty($username)) {\n        $message = \"<p style='color: red;'>Username is required!<\/p>\";\n    } elseif ($email === false) {\n        $message = \"<p style='color: red;'>Invalid email format!<\/p>\";\n    } else {\n        \/\/ Data is clean and valid\n        $message = \"<p style='color: green;'>Thank you, **{$username}**!

Connecting to a MySQL Database (Using PDO)\n\nThis modern approach uses PDO (PHP Data Objects) for secure database interaction.\n\n**Note:** This code requires a running MySQL\/MariaDB server and a database named `my_database` with a table named `users`.\n\n**File:** `db_example.php`\n\n```php\n<?php\n\/\/ Database connection parameters\n$host = 'localhost';\n$db   = 'my_database';\n$user = 'db_user';     \/\/ Replace with your actual user\n$pass = 'db_password'; \/\/ Replace with your actual password\n$charset = 'utf8mb4';\n\n$dsn = \"mysql:host=$host;dbname=$db;charset=$charset\";\n$options = [\n    PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE            => PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION,\n    PDO::ATTR_DEFAULT_FETCH_MODE => PDO::FETCH_ASSOC,\n    PDO::ATTR_EMULATE_PREPARES   => false,\n];\n\ntry {\n    \/\/ 1.

Basic PHP Syntax and Output\n\nThis is the classic \"Hello, World!\" example, showing how PHP is embedded within HTML.\n\n### `index.php`\n\n```php\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>Basic PHP Output<\/title>\n<\/head>\n<body>\n\n    <h1>Welcome to My PHP Page<\/h1>\n\n    <?php\n        \/\/ PHP code starts here\n\n        $greeting = \"Hello, World!\";\n        $year = 2024;\n\n        \/\/ Outputting variables and text\n        echo \"<p>The greeting is: <strong>\" . $greeting . \"<\/strong><\/p>\";\n        echo \"<p>The current year is $year.<\/p>\";\n\n        \/\/ Outputting the current date\/time using a built-in function\n        echo \"<p>Today's date is: \" . date(\"Y-m-d H:i:s\") . \"<\/p>\";\n\n        \/\/ PHP code ends here\n    ?>\n\n    <p>This is standard HTML again.<\/p>\n\n<\/body>\n<\/html>\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2. Using Functions and Control Structures (Loops)\n\nThis example demonstrates how to define a function and use a `for` loop.\n\n### `functions.php`\n\n```php\n<?php\n\/\/ Define a function that calculates the square of a number\nfunction calculateSquare($number) {\n    return $number * $number;\n}\n\n\/\/ Set up an array of numbers\n$numbers = [1, 5, 8, 12, 15];\n\necho \"<h1>Function and Loop Example<\/h1>\";\n\n\/\/ Use a foreach loop to iterate over the array\necho \"<h2>Squares of the numbers:<\/h2>\";\necho \"<ul>\";\n\nforeach ($numbers as $num) {\n    $result = calculateSquare($num);\n    echo \"<li>The square of $num is: $result<\/li>\";\n\n    \/\/ Example of an if condition\n    if ($result > 100) {\n        echo \" (This is a large number!)\";\n    }\n}\n\necho \"<\/ul>\";\n\n?>\n```\n\n---\n\n## 3. Handling User Input (POST Form)\n\nThis is a classic two-file example showing how to create a form and process the submitted data using the `$_POST` superglobal array.\n\n### File 1: `form.html` (The HTML Form)\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>PHP Form Example<\/title>\n<\/head>\n<body>\n\n    <h1>Simple Contact Form<\/h1>\n\n    <!-- \n        The 'action' attribute points to the PHP file that will handle the data.\n        The 'method' attribute specifies how the data is sent (POST is usually preferred for form data).\n    -->\n    <form action=\"process.php\" method=\"POST\">\n        <label for=\"name\">Name:<\/label>\n        <input type=\"text\" id=\"name\" name=\"user_name\" required><br><br>\n\n        <label for=\"email\">Email:<\/label>\n        <input type=\"email\" id=\"email\" name=\"user_email\" required><br><br>\n\n        <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\">\n    <\/form>\n\n<\/body>\n<\/html>\n```\n\n### File 2: `process.php` (The PHP Handler)\n\n```php\n<?php\n\/\/ Check if the form was actually submitted using the POST method\nif ($_SERVER[\"REQUEST_METHOD\"] == \"POST\") {\n    \n    \/\/ Retrieve data from the $_POST superglobal array\n    \/\/ The keys ('user_name', 'user_email') match the 'name' attributes in form.html\n\n    $name = htmlspecialchars($_POST['user_name']);\n    $email = htmlspecialchars($_POST['user_email']); \/\/ Use htmlspecialchars for basic sanitation\n\n    echo \"<h1>Form Submission Successful!<\/h1>\";\n    echo \"<p>Thank you, <strong>$name<\/strong>.<\/p>\";\n    echo \"<p>We will contact you shortly at <strong>$email<\/strong>.<\/p>\";\n\n    \/\/ In a real application, you would save this data to a database or send an email here.\n\n} else {\n    \/\/ If someone tries to access process.php directly without submitting the form\n    header(\"Location: form.html\");\n    exit();\n}\n?>\n```\n\n---\n\n## 4. Connecting to a MySQL Database (PDO)\n\nThis advanced example uses the modern, secure **PDO (PHP Data Objects)** method to connect to a database and fetch records.\n\n***Note: This code will only run if you have a MySQL server running and the specified database\/credentials exist.***\n\n### `database_example.php`\n\n```php\n<?php\n\n\/\/ Database connection parameters\n$host = 'localhost';\n$db   = 'your_database_name';\n$user = 'your_database_user';\n$pass = 'your_database_password';\n$charset = 'utf8mb4';\n\n$dsn = \"mysql:host=$host;dbname=$db;charset=$charset\";\n$options = [\n    PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE            => PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION,\n    PDO::ATTR_DEFAULT_FETCH_MODE => PDO::FETCH_ASSOC,\n    PDO::ATTR_EMULATE_PREPARES   => false,\n];\n\ntry {\n     $pdo = new PDO($dsn, $user, $pass, $options);\n     echo \"<h1>Database Connection Successful!<\/h1>\";\n\n     \/\/ 1. SELECT Query using prepared statements (best practice)\n     $stmt = $pdo->prepare('SELECT id, name, email FROM users WHERE active = ?');\n     $stmt->execute([1]); \/\/ Execute with the active status (1)\n\n     echo \"<h2>User List:<\/h2>\";\n     echo \"<ul>\";\n     \n     \/\/ Loop through the results\n     while ($row = $stmt->fetch()) {\n         echo \"<li>ID: \" . $row['id'] . \" | Name: \" . $row['name'] . \" | Email: \" . $row['email'] . \"<\/li>\";\n     }\n     \n     echo \"<\/ul>\";\n\n} catch (\\PDOException $e) {\n     \/\/ Handle connection or query errors\n     throw new \\PDOException($e->getMessage(), (int)$e->getCode());\n     \/\/ In a production environment, you would log this error, not display it.\n}\n\n?>\n```",

    "result": "The temporal map was as fragile and ethereal as a butterfly wing. Elara ran, holding the newly printed paper carefully against the cold night air. The ink had dried instantly, yet still retained a faint, blue heat that seeped into her fingers.\n\nShe burst out of the Whispering Marshes, trading the cold, wet muck for the rough, familiar gravel of the old logging road leading back toward Oakhaven.\n\nShe checked her watch: **10:07 PM.** Less than two hours until midnight.\n\nThe map was terrifying. It showed the entire Eastern Seaboard, but instead of towns and borders, it was segmented by glowing lines that shifted and pulsed\u2014causal vectors.\n\nThis was Thorne\u2019s true genius, and the secret the Trust guarded.\n\n### The Cartography of Causality (Educate)\n\nElara, a librarian by trade, was intimately familiar with the concept of **Historical Stratigraphy**\u2014the way archaeologists and historians treat history like geological layers, where one event (stratum) lies on top of another. But Thorne\u2019s map didn't just show layers; it showed the *tension* between them.\n\nThe blue vectors indicated moments of high **Temporal Mass**\u2014events whose sheer significance anchored other timelines. The red vectors indicated **Fissures**\u2014places where causality had been broken or compressed.\n\nThe map centered on a small, dark shape corresponding exactly to the location of the Silent Circle. Radiating outward from this spot was a complex, beautiful, and sickening network of red lines that connected directly to major historical events across the last century.\n\n\"He didn't remove history,\" Elara realized, running harder. \"He created a century-long pressure valve. The wound wasn't sealed to be forgotten; it was sealed to *contain* the pressure.\"\n\nThorne hadn't excised a moment; he had excised the *consequences* of a moment. The Silent Circle acted as a massive historical vacuum, absorbing the logical outcome of some great, forbidden truth from 1925. By cracking the seal, Elara had allowed the vacuum to shatter.\n\nAnd the release wasn't going to be slow diffusion; it was an explosive decompression.\n\n### The Echo Rises (Engage\/Entertain)\n\nAs she followed the glowing vectors on the map, they all converged on a single point in Oakhaven: the great, iron tower of the town hall, housing the massive grandfather clock.\n\n*\u201cMidnight is the Release.\u201d*\n\nThe clock was the town\u2019s official keeper of time, the symbol of its predictable, orderly existence. If the pressure of a century of suppressed reality was released, it would naturally target the nexus of the town\u2019s temporal stability.\n\nElara entered the deserted outskirts of Oakhaven. Here, the air was suddenly sharp with ozone. Time itself felt fluid. She passed a lamppost, and the light above her flickered violently, cycling through a full day: dawn, midday glare, dusk, then back to the static night light, all in the space of a single footfall.\n\nShe saw a newspaper fluttering past, its headline momentarily flashing from \"Thorne Vanishes, 1925\" to \"Oakhaven Founders' Day, 2025,\" before settling back into a blurry middle ground.\n\nThe **Echo** was rising\u2014the suppressed reality was fighting to reassert itself.\n\nThe Clock Tower loomed ahead, an impossibly dark silhouette against the crescent moon. Its base was surrounded by a decorative iron fence.\n\nElara slowed, finally reaching the paved town square. **10:55 PM.**\n\nSuddenly, the air behind her warped.\n\nA sound like grinding metal and ripping silk announced the return of the Silence Guardian. He hadn't just recovered; he had weaponized the fragments of his broken square obsidian seal.\n\nHe stepped out of a shimmering spatial fold near the town fountain. He was no longer using a flashlight; the fractured piece of the Seal of Absolution, held aloft in his hand, glowed with violent, chaotic green and blue light, causing the very stone of the square to ripple like water.\n\n\"The clock is the mechanism, Elara,\" the man hissed, his voice echoing from multiple directions at once, distorted by the temporal disruption he was causing. \"Thorne thought he could simply pause the inevitable. I will ensure that the clock doesn't just seal the memory; I will ensure it seals the *timeline*.\"\n\nHe pointed the fractured stone at the iron fence around the clock tower.\n\nThe fence immediately liquefied, the rigid iron stretching and twisting into impossible, looping geometric shapes that covered the entrance, forming an impenetrable barrier woven from time and metal.\n\n\"You cannot pass the moment of deletion,\" the Guardian stated, stepping toward her, the ground turning to liquid beneath his boots.\n\nElara stopped dead, clutching the Temporal Map. She couldn't fight the man, and she certainly couldn't fight physics being turned inside out. She looked up at the clock face, now obscured by a glowing distortion.\n\nShe had to get to the clock\u2019s heart.\n\nShe glanced at the map one last time. It didn't just show the convergence point; it showed a small, faded vector line\u2014an escape route, or perhaps, Thorne\u2019s final key. It pointed not to the ground floor, but to a maintenance tunnel entrance beneath the town\u2019s oldest landmark, located directly across the square: **The Oakhaven Historical Gazebo.**\n\n\"You sealed the consequences, Guardian,\" Elara yelled back, dodging a shard of temporally destabilized pavement that shot past her ear. \"But you forgot that causality is a river, not a pond! Thorne left a way around the current.\"\n\nElara pivoted and sprinted toward the gazebo, the man's enraged shouts echoing across the square as he realized her intent.\n\nShe reached the ornate, wooden lattice of the gazebo and dropped to her knees. Hidden beneath decades of fallen leaves and dirt was a rusted, rectangular metal grate\u2014exactly where the temporal map had indicated.\n\nElara shoved the map into her satchel and pulled out the trapezoidal obsidian. It pulsed, confirming this was the right path. With a grunt, she wedged the stone into the grate\u2019s handle groove and twisted.\n\nThe rusted latch snapped open, and a blast of subterranean, damp air rushed out. She scrambled down into the dark opening, pulling the grate shut just as the Silence Guardian\u2019s temporal distortion field washed over the gazebo, making the structure groan and shimmer around her.\n\nShe had escaped the square, but she was now trapped in the service tunnels beneath the town, heading toward the heart of the Oakhaven clock tower.\n\nShe needed to get inside before **11:00 PM**, or she feared the Echo would rise to meet her in the dark.",

The glow of the Oakhaven clock tower grew brighter, pulling her toward it.\n\n**9:58 PM.**\n\nShe paused at the edge of the woods, unfolding the heavy, burning paper. The map was indeed the Eastern Seaboard, but the lines weren't routes; they were vectors showing where historical moments were being drawn from, and where they were being sent.\n\n*EDUCATION:* Silas Thorne hadn't just excised a moment; he had archived it, storing the century of suppressed memory in a kind of **temporal reservoir**. The map showed these vectors converging, not randomly, but with impossible precision, on a single, tiny, pulsating point in Oakhaven: the brass mechanism inside the old municipal clock tower.\n\nThorne hadn't hidden a secret in the marsh; he had engineered a time bomb into the town\u2019s own heartbeat. The Silent Circle was the storage site; the Clock Tower was the release trigger.\n\nIf midnight was the release, the history of the last hundred years\u2014the \"echo\" the guardian feared\u2014was about to flood back into the present reality.\n\nElara shoved the map into her satchel and broke into a sprint across the manicured lawn of the town square, arriving just as the heavy, bronze machinery above her groaned into action.\n\nThe first bell of the hour began its slow, monumental descent.\n\n**DONG.**\n\nShe looked up at the clock face. The minute hand was one tick away from vertical.\n\n**10:00 PM.**\n\n**DONG.**\n\nElara threw her shoulder against the ancient oak door at the base of the tower.
